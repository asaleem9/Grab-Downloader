saving functionality simplifies downloading content from the internet
and we take zero liability for what the saved content is used for.

processing servers operate like advanced proxies and don't ever write any requested content to disk.
everything is handled in RAM and permanently purged once the tunnel is completed.
we have no downloading logs and cannot identify anyone.

you can learn more about how tunnels work in [privacy policy](/about/privacy).
